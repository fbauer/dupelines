dupelines - Visualisation of duplicated source code lines
=========================================================

Warning: this code in unmaintained. 

Show similarity between two text files by generating a scatter plot,
where each line of the first file is compared with each line of the
second file. If the lines are the same, a dot is plotted at the
 (first lineno, second lineno) coordinate.  This gives a quick visual
 overview of the similarity between two files.
